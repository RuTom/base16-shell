# Base16 Shell
**This is a fork! It has changes that fit my use but do not reflect any vision the base16 project has.**

See the [Base16-shell main repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) for the original version.

See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.  
These scripts were built with [Base16 Builder PHP](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder-php).

A shell script to change your shell's default ANSI colors but most importantly, colors 17 to 21 of your shell's 256 colorspace (if supported by your terminal). This script makes it possible to honor the original bright colors of your shell (e.g. bright green is still green and so on) while providing additional base16 colors to applications such as Vim.
